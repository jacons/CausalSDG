# CausalSDG
This framework generates synthetic tabular data using Structural Causal Models, capturing explicit causal relationships. It supports realistic data creation, augmentation, controlled model testing, simulations of interventions, and privacy-preserving data sharing, with flexible graph and function definitions.
